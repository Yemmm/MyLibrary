Built Following FreeCodeCamp with Meicode Android Tutorial

There's a lot of fundamental concepts that made this project a good start at diving into Android Development. A lot of the code is more of a proof of concept and more of a Sample than a complete work.
This project will be more of a sandbox to test other technologies and see how features could be enhanced as well as API upgrades

Made following a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp via MeiCode
